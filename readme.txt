Ethan Kleiber Software Engineering Section B
Ari'jaye Derritt Software Engineering Section B

This assignment wasn't too bad. The code itself seemed easy
enough to write. We got to the end and were really confused on
if we had actually done it correctly or not because given the 
assignment description, it wasn't made explicity clear what the 
output should look like. After breaking it down together and having
chatGPT explain some of the logic on what was happening and why
we are getting the output we are, we understood that our code was 
correct, we just didn't understand that we were just trying to test
different kinds of advanced exception handling in this 
assignment.
